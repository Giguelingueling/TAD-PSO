# TAD-PSO
Python implementation of the TAD-PSO algorithm

The World file is provide an example for utilizing the algorithm (Optimization of the Schwefel function in 100D over 500 000 evaluations).

The Creature file contain the particle object and their related behaviors (updating fitness, position, etc). The Swarm file handle how creatures relate and interact with each others.

Finally, the FitnessFunction file contains various benchmarks function to test the algorithms on.
